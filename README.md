# Detecting-the-difficulty-level-of-French-texts
You have decided to form a startup called “LingoRank” with your University friend and become a millionaire. You have until the end the semester to create a proof of concept for your investors. Your startup will revolutionize the way people learn and get better at a foreign language.
THE IDEA
You have noticed that to improve one’s skills in a new foreign language, it is important to read texts in that language. These texts have to be at the reader’s language level. However, it is difficult to find texts that are close to someone’s knowledge level (A1 to C2). You have decided to build a model for English speakers that predicts the difficulty of a French written text. This can be then used, e.g., in a recommendation system, to recommend texts, e.g, recent news articles that are appropriate for someone’s language level. If someone is at A1 French level, it is inappropriate to present a text at B2 level, as she won’t be able to understand it. Ideally, a text should have many known words and may have a few words that are unknown so that the person can improve.
